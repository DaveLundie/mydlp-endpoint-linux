Linux Printer Filtering. Under development.

mydlpdaemon.py must be started before any printing job. It does not have any specific path. It must be started with root privileges

testcups should be placed in /usr/lib/cups/filter. This script is bridge between MyDLP and CUPS.

maincups.py should be placed in /usr/lib/cups/filter. This script sends print jobs to the mydlpdaemon.

File '/usr/share/cups/mime/cupsfilter.convs' should be modified  with:

sed -i "s/^\(application\/pdf\s*application\/vnd.cups-pdf\s*\w*\s*\).*\$/\1mydlp-cups/" /usr/share/cups/mime/cupsfilters.convs
 
-- "application/pdf         application/vnd.cups-pdf                22      pdftopdf" 
	replace with
++ "application/pdf         application/vnd.cups-pdf                22      testcups"
